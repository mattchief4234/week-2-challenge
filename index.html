      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="about-me">I consider myself and simple man with simple tastes. As long as I get to drink some Hot-Chocolate
        with hazelnut and carmel syrup and wip creme on top and read some manga then I am in bliss. I have loved
        reading since I was little, especially comic books, it wasnt until I was in middle-shool and high-school that
        I really discovered the japanese equivilent to comic books, manga. I have also been drawing since I was young 
        and I would draw what I read or saw on that page. This grew into my wanting to learn about how to create my own 
        comics, and that lead me to learning about how to draw and paint digitally instead of physically with real supplies.
        And THAT lead me all the way into computers and building them and learning how to code. It has been a very DEEP
        rabbit hole but I can say that it has been an amazing ride!

                <p>I do try and post stuff there semi-regularly moslty about games that I am playing and I might even try and post my art there as well. Although, i know that 
                  the youtube algorythm will play a bit nicer if I create an entirely new account for that kind of stuff.

                <p>This is exclusivly art, I dont upload as much since a lot of my time is taken up by working, study, reading and now coding! I do
                  try to make an effort with my art, and a lot of what I am working on isn't even uploaded or teased on this instagram account. I just upload for fun really.

                <p>Here is where I plan to upload a lot of the school work that I am going to work on. You will find
                  all of the weekly challenges neatly and precicsly labeled. Once class is over I will keep a few active but I will begin working on some
                  personal projects and the class work will then be made private. I hope to produce some great work that many can look at and refference!
