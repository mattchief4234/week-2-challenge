# Week-2-Challenge READ ME


## This entire project was kinda hectic but after looking back on it I realized just how far I have come in the 2 or 3 weeks that I have started code. I feel a bit more confident in reading code and debugging. It can write code learn how to apply code in different places and 'bend it to my will' as one might say! What I found particulaly hard was the "FEATURED" section and how there must be an animation on it to present the link for you to click on. I found it SUPER satisfying once I Did find it out. I hope you find much to learn and glean as well as where YOU the viwer and reader could improve upon, as I know that the code is RAW and may be full of mistakes or inefficienies. As always ENJOY!

## Installation

the required steps are as follows:
 Step 1) Develop the "bear bones" of the website using HTML. Input the correct informmation and where that infromatoin is to sit and in which order they are to be arranged.
 Step 2) Futher optimize that order from chaos using CSS. Give the website a cleaner and more user friendly look by inputting border and colors to specific lines of code. This also makes it much easier to read.
 Step 3) Make sure the animations and picture backgrounds wereworking Properly. (this took me a while to do!)

## Usage

This website is not as usable as it looks, BUT it is a testiment to the new skills and knowledge that I gained while only 2 weeks in the class. I hope this make a website liek this in the future and acutally make it more usable.


## Credits

I want to thank the teachers, instructors and tutors at the University of Utah and their patience in not only creating this amazing course but in their patience and long suffereing in teaching me and helping me further understand beyond what they are trying to achieve. Teach how to do it, the application and also the thought process behind it.
